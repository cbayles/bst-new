      concerning the Big Sky Tournament, which is to be held at Las Vegas &amp; 
      Mesquite, Nevada.</SPAN></FONT></P>
      <P class=MsoNormal><FONT color=#ffffff><SPAN 
      style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">&nbsp;The first thing I want you to know about 
      is a new web site for the outing. John Graves and Bob Langley suggested 
      this site last year, but we didn't have the time or resources to get it 
      done. But John suggested the site again this year and my son Christopher 
      is in process of bringing it to life. Although the site is still under 
      construction, it can be viewed at: (to avoid the link attachment, please 
      add "www." to front of this address) " geocities.com/bigskyvegas

      additional tee times at 3:00 on the Vistas 9 course for those that would 
      want to play 9 more holes which will be optional and not a part of the Big 
      Sky Tournament, but John Graves has promised to come up with a "game" to 
      make it more interesting for those that participate.

      I have agreed to a service that I hope everyone will be ok with. For $4.50 
      a person they will provide group baggage handling, which means they will 
      carry our bags to our rooms when we check in, and from the room to the 
      lobby at checkout. This charge will also assist in getting us into the 
      newly renovated tower at Bally's (not a guarantee, but should 
      assist).</SPAN></FONT></P>
